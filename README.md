## Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- Preprocessing images for better recognition accuracy
- Visualizations of detected faces
- Easy-to-follow code snippets and explanations

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
`pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Naecrae77/face-recognition-with-OpenCV.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
   jupyter notebook FacedetectionandprocessingwithopenCV_Sam.ipynb
```

## Usage

1. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute face detection on sample images or video streams.
3. Modify parameters as necessary to experiment with different configurations.

## Code Explanation

The notebook is structured into several sections:

- **Importing Libraries**: Essential libraries are imported to facilitate image processing and visualization.
  
- **Loading Images**: Code for loading images from your local directory or capturing from a webcam.

- **Face Detection**: Implementation of Haar Cascade Classifier for detecting faces in images.

- **Image Processing**: Preprocessing techniques applied to enhance image quality for better recognition.

- **Visualization**: Displaying results with detected faces highlighted.

For detailed explanations of each section, refer to the comments within the notebook.
